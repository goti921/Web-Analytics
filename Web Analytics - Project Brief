Web Analytics - Project Brief
1. Please create 7 page dummy website with a username and password for log-in. The site should have the following features as a part of the dummy content:

 - video (you can pick any video from you tube).
 - one page content (an article copy pasted from any content)
 - a digital banner (a picture) which links to external page (Google.com opens in a separate window).
(You can have mix and match of above items in different pages.)

2. Also create a Back-End Module which can capture the User Behavior on the following lines:
 - Time spent on Each Content Item
 - Migration flow from one item to another
 - Track Clicks on Banner Consumption

Build a back end view page to display the captured data as Analytics. We should log-in as admin to see the details. 

Any additional features you may think would be a value add on.
